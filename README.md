## What is it?

**castaway** is a simple library to add an `as` language construct to Objective-C.

```objc
NSObject* obj = /* get an object */;

obj.as(^(id<Drawable> drawable) {
    [drawable draw];
});
```

The typical way to do this without castaway is:

```objc
NSObject* obj = /* get an object */;

if ([obj conformsToProtocol:@protocol(Drawable)]) {
    [(id<Drawable>)obj draw];
}
```

It's verbose, repetitive, and the compiler isn't checking that you cast to the same protocol you checked for.

castaway makes it dead simple to write concise and declarative code that's safe.

castaway also includes a `match` construct to write safe type-dependent code for multiple cases.

```objc
id result = /* get a result */;

result.match(@[
    ^(NSArray* manyThings) {
        for (id thing in manyThings) { /* ... */ }
    },
    ^(NSString* str) {
        NSLog(@"The string: %@", str);
    },
    ^(UIView* view) {
        [view removeFromSuperview];
    },
    ^(id somethingElse) {
        NSLog(@"wasn't expecting: %@", somethingElse);
    }
]);
```

The `match` construct returns the result of the executed block that matched.

```objc
NSString* description = obj.match(@[
    ^(NSArray* manyThings) {
        return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d things", manyThings.count];
    },
    ^(NSString* str) {
        return @"one string";
    },
    ^(id somethingElse) {
        return @"one random thing";
    }
]);
```

If `obj` is an NSArray of 3 items, `description` is `"3 things"`. If `obj` is a string, it's `"one string"`. Otherwise it's `"one random thing"`.

## Installation

castaway is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "castaway"

Then, you just need to import the castaway header:

```objc
#import <castaway/castaway.h>
```
    
## Calling `as` on `id` types

In the above examples, we used `as` and `match` with dot-syntax. You're not able to use property syntax on `id` typed variables, so you should use the message versions of `as` and `match`.

```objc
id obj = /* get an object */;

[obj as:^(id<Drawable> drawable) {
    [drawable draw];
}]; 
```
